//Title: Exploitation of Windows Server Update Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-59287)
//Description: On October 23, Microsoft released an out-of-band update for a remote code execution bug in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS); WSUS is a centralized Microsoft update distribution service for IT administrators.
