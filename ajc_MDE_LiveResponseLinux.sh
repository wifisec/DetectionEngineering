# SYNOPSIS
#     Collects specified system and configuration files from a Linux host for DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) purposes.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     This script collects various system and configuration files from a Linux host, logs details about the collected files (including file existence, size, permissions, and SHA1 hash), and compresses the collected files and log into a single archive. The script ensures all actions occur under a subfolder named with the current date and time under the MDTAP user's home directory.
#
#     The script includes functionalities to:
#         - Identify the home directory of the MDTAP user.
#         - Create a unique subfolder using the current date and time.
#         - Collect specified files and directories.
#         - Log detailed information about each collected file.
#         - Compress the collected files and log into a single archive.
#         - Clean up the collected files after compression.
